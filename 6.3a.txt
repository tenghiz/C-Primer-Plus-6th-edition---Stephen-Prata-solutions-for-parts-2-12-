//6.3 - This is a modofocation of previously composed program

//Please check Listing 6.10 in textbook of Prata.
// Textbook's code repeats SHOWMENU() and CIN>>CHOICE outside and inside the loop.
// The code can be simplified using either construction WHILE(TRUE) or
// initializing CHAR CH from the beginning to some aleatory value which will not interfere with WHILE statement.
